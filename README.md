Note: this project is not supported anymore

## C# Layer Factory

LayerCake Generator is a **free** and **open source** Layer Factory for Microsoft .NET applications. It is designed to save you time in thinking and architecturing your software and reducing the number of coding errors.

## Service Architecture

Within 5 minutes you can step through the two screens necessary to create a complete C# **service architecture** and start your development. Design your database and deploy a C# Visual Studio solution at the glance!

## Non-Intrusive

It is designed to be discrete and user-friendly. Your application code doesn't need to depend on LayerCake Generator directly. Once published LayerCake Generator no longer exists.
